        <h1>Docker</h1>
        <p>Docker is software written for creating, managing and deploying <em>containerized</em> applications.
           This means that you have full control over the environment your application runs in, including the software it relies on.</p>
        <p>You could have one container running a WordPress install with PHP 7.4, while having another container running that requires PHP 7.2 without both versions causing problems for each other.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Why not just use a VM?</em></strong> Containers are much more lightweight and performant because you do not need to emulate all the hardware of a virtual machine. Containers use the same kernel as the host, but build their own layers on top.</p>
        <p>If you use <em>Docker-Compose</em>, you store the setup for your container in a simpl .yaml file. Wherever you want to (re-)create that same Docker container or stack, you just have to copy the .yaml file, run the command <em>docker-compose up</em>, and you're set!</p>
